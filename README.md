Kickstarter trend analysis based on launch date

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
 The purpose of this project was to shed some light on the outcomes of successful, failed and canceled Kickstarter campaigns based on their funding goals and launch date. As you will see, the funding goal is a seemingly important factor in whether or not the campaign will be successful.

## Analysis and Challenges
 ** Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
 #### Analysis:
 * For this project I started with converting the launch and deadline dates from Unix to a timestamps. This allowed me to see the timestamps in a manageable format. The Category and Subcategory column was separated by delimiter to allow for more granular analysis.
 * Next a pivot table was created to allow for visualization of the monthly trends of the outcomes. The timestamps were grouped by month to allow us the get a look at which months were 
 
 #### Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Components: Pivot table & Line Chart
*
As you can see from the pivot table, the most successful months for kickstarters were May and June

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Components: Manually created table and Line Chart

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
